# Angular-Phaser project seed

## Purpose

This project is a template (or seed) to build in-browser games with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). Phaser is already integrated with an Angular application and can be run as-is to see a very basic example of a Phaser animation.

## How to use it

### Use as project template in Github (recommended)

Click on the green button **Use this template** on the Github repo home page. As simple as that! ðŸš€

### Clone (alternative)

If, for some reasons, you don't want to go through the Github interface, you can still clone the project and change its remote url.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Blockost/angular-phaser-seed.git
$ cd angular-phaser-seed
$ git git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/YOUR-REPO
$ git push -u origin master
```
